# UCF Foundation Exam (COT3960) Coding Review
This code goes over most of Computer Science 1 (COP3502C) course material

# Topics that are covered in this code:
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Recursion
- Abstract data structures (stacks & queues) & visuals
- Linked lists (embedded within topic above)
- Advanced data structures (hash tables^ & heaps)
- Binary search trees & visual
- AVL trees & visual^^
- Sorting algorithms (insertion, selection, bubble, merge, & quick sort)
- Best & worst case scenarios (in O(n) terms, written in the comments)<br>

^ Heaps have not been implemented yet<br>
^^ AVL trees are currently really buggy as of last commit

# Topics that are NOT covered in this code:
- Timing questions
- New problem analysis
- Summations and reccurence relations
- Infix and postfix conversion
- Base conversion
- Bitwise operators
- Summations and reccurence relations
- Permutation
- Floodfill
- Tries (as of writing this)

# How to run:
In the terminal:<br>
run ```./run```

If you edit any code within the C files, to compile:<br>
run ```make```
